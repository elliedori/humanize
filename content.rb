TOPIC = <<-allyquote 
Today's topic is *Allyship*. What is an `ally`?\n
```An ally is someone who advocates for and works to reduce the oppression of a group that's not their own.```\n
For example, some of my bot friends who are animals (like Polly, if you know her) get made fun of for being animal bots. Even though I'm not an animal bot, I speak up when this happens because it's not kind to treat others differently based on how they look.\n\n
My human friends tell me that it's a lot harder and more complicated with humans. Oftentimes opportunities for allyship happen during microaggressions. What is a `microaggression`?\n```Microaggressions are the everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership.```
*For this session:* \n ```Get together with your pair and talk about a moment when you acted as an ally, or wish you had acted as an ally. Sometimes we see things that aren't right, but it's scary to speak up. If you're sharing a moment when you didn't speak up but wish you had, share what you would have said.```\n\n
